# Speech_classification
In this repository you will see how to solve a speech classification task in Python. First, with a simple ML algorithm and then with more complex DL methods.

## General info
After finishing with good results a University Machine Learning challenge, I decided to share it with you. This challenge was hosted in [Codalab](https://codalab.org/) and my team reached the *5th* position among 80+ teams. As previously mentioned we will deal with different ML and DL algorithms, namely:

* Decision Forest
* CNN 2D
* CNN 1D

Unfortunately I cannot upload here the data because they are too big, in the notebooks I will guide you to download and process them. 

## Code
If you want to have a big overview of the project [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/F-Lauria/Speech_classification/blob/master/code/Speech_recognizition.ipynb) you can find it. Otherwise, let me guide you step by step:

* [Data_processing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/F-Lauria/Speech_classification/blob/master/code/Data_processing.ipynb)
* [Decision_forest](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/F-Lauria/Speech_classification/blob/master/code/Decision_forest.ipynb)
* [2D CNN](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/F-Lauria/Speech_classification/blob/master/code/2D_CNN.ipynb)
* [1D CNN](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/F-Lauria/Speech_classification/blob/master/code/1D_CNN.ipynb)

## Technologies

All the algorithms are written in Python. The hardware of my machine is not powerful so I ran all the models in Google Colab, [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/one-stop-guide-to-google-colab-d67c94d30516) a nice tutorial.

## Dependencies 

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Keras
