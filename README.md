## General info
After finishing with good results this University Machine Learning challenge, I decided to share it with you. This challenge was hosted in [Google CodeLabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com) and my team reached the *5th* position among 80+ teams. As previously mentioned we will deal with different ML and DL algorithms, namely:

* Decision Forest
* CNN 2D
* CNN 1D
